# Project Overview

I initially created this project in 2017 and, for various reasons, haven't been able to update it further. Nevertheless, I welcome you to utilize it for corrections, improvements, or as a helpful guideline.

## Important Notes

- The source code may exhibit unconventional naming conventions for classes and variables, reflecting a beginner's approach at the time of creation.
- You might find code in unexpected or peculiar sections due to the necessity of decompiling it when some files were missing.
